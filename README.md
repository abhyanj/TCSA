One of the most traumatizing events that could happen in life is getting Thunder Cross Split Attacked. This legs-spread, hamon-filled, intrusively sexy attack has plagued chats and instagram feeds for many generations. Unless you are Dio, it is said that no fighter has escaped this potent attack. That is, until now.

TCSA aims to check videos and images for traces of TCSA using image recognition and deep learning. Now you could be like vampire Dio and avoid getting punked by chatmates.
